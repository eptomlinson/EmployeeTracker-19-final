# Krusty Krab Employee Directory

Are ya ready, kids?!

Mr. Krabs' dev budget is dirt cheap, so he's turned to a member of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp for an "intern" (he's paying me in Krabby Patties) to make his new employee directory. I'm the sucker who volunteered, so here's the new and improved Krusty Krab Employee Tracker (previously Rolodex).

The website is deployed at this URL: https://tranquil-gorge-52847.herokuapp.com/

The GitHub repo is located here: https://github.com/eptomlinson/EmployeeTracker-19-final

Once you arrive at the site, you may use the search bar to search by employee name. Here is the complete duty roster: SpongeBob Squarepants, Mr. Krabs, Squidward Tentacles, Patrick Star, Dirty Dan, Plankton, King Neptune, & Sandy Cheeks.

The search feature is case sensitive, so be sure to capitalize the first letter of the name you are searching for.
